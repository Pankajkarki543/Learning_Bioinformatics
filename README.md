**Learning Bioinformatics Repository**                                                                                                                                            
This repository is a journey of self-learning in bioinformatics for beginners. It contains a series of projects aimed at gaining practical experience with various bioinformatics techniques and tools. As I continue on my bioinformatics learning path, additional projects will be added to provide a wider range of learning opportunities.
